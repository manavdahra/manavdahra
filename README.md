- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Manav Dahra.
- I have close to 10 years of experience as a backend engineer working with a variety of technology stacks and domains. To me Software Engineering is application of Math, logic, and creative problem-solving. Being curious is my strength I would say.
- I often spend time in weekends trying to understand how systems work under the hood. This involves some experimenting and reverse engineering. This helps me to develop a more holistic, finer outlook on computer science and eventually to develop better solutions at work.
- I want to adopt a more sophisticated and comprehensive perspective on computer science. Recently, I started to delve more deeply into some popular technologies that people take for granted. Like - Databases, distributed systems, concurrency, computer graphics, machine learning, Advanced Algorithms & DS. much more... I can never claim that I have learnt enough, or that I am the best expert in the town and I guess that is ok... as long as the learning never stops. It's the progress that matters in the end, doesn't matter where the starting point is.
- Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate on anything that matches my skillset and brings opportunity for growth and learning.
