- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Manav Dahra. 
  My interest lies in problem solving, math and logical reasoning. To me software engineering is an application of those analytical skills sprinkled with creativity.
  During the times when I am more curious, I like to spend my time peeking on how things work under the hood and possibly borrow some ingenious ideas to apply into my work.
- Iâ€™m always interested in anything that is novel and challenging.
- Currently I'm transitioning into the next phase of my career where I am diving deeper into how databases and distributed systems work. 
  I'm also brushing up my DS and Algo skills but with more wisdom now. I'm aiming to develop a more holistic and finer outlook on computer science.
- Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate on anything that matches my skillset and brings opportunity for growth and learning.
